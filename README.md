# Chip-8-Emulator
A Chip 8 emulator I coded with the help of a tutorial by Austin Morlan (https://austinmorlan.com/posts/chip8_emulator/)

## Important
A Chip 8 ROM is necessary to run the emulator. Feel free to download one from GitHub or elsewhere.

## To Run
- Navigate to project directory
- In terminal: `g++ main.cpp`
- `./a.out <screen-size> <time-delay> <path-to-rom>`
  - Example: `./a.out 200 3 Breakout.ch8`
  
## Enjoy!
